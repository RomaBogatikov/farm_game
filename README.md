## Overview

## Technologies used:
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery

## The game showcases the usage of:
* JavaScript Classes (including extended classes and factories),
* AJAX calls to [weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) (farmer's income depends on the temperature in a chosen city),
* localStorage,
* drag and drop (with a helper function to preserve the size of a draggable image),
* modals,
* custom CSS variables,
* Flexbox
* responsive design (mobile friendly).
